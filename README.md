# TCP_CLIENT_SERVER_1

This is my effort to create a simple TCP/IP server with Qt framework in C++. 
Unfortunately, I have issues with compiling and building the application due to an error with main(), even though main() method is defined. 
In theory, once the build is successful, the GUI would be built too as per requirements, and the IP address, sender ID, and messages can be sent to the server or listener.
